    "**Answer**: iii. Steadily increase\n",
    "\n",
    "Increases as s increases due to more model flexibility. The model becomes more susceptible to noise in training data, leading to continuously increasing variance.\n",

    "**Answer**: iv. Steadily decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "Decreases as s increases due to fewer model constraints. The model better captures true relationships, resulting in continuously decreasing bias.\n",

    "Represents inherent noise in data and is independent of model complexity. Therefore, it remains constant regardless of changes in s."
