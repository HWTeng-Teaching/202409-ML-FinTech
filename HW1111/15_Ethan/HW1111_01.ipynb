As\n","𝑠\n","s increases, the model becomes more flexible and can better adapt to the training data. This results in a steady decrease in training RSS, as the model minimizes errors on the training set regardless of generalization."],"metadata":{"id":"AKYiEcSzxMbe"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(b) As we increase\n","𝑠\n","s from 0, the test RSS will:\n","Answer: (ii) Decrease initially, and then eventually start increasing in a U shape.\n","Explanation:\n","Test RSS reflects the model's performance on unseen data. Initially, as\n","𝑠\n","s increases, the model reduces bias and fits the true patterns in the data better, leading to a decrease in test RSS. However, beyond a certain point, the model starts overfitting the training data (capturing noise instead of patterns), which increases test RSS. This forms a U-shaped curve."],"metadata":{"id":"9RDsoY4TxN8o"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(c) As we increase\n","𝑠\n","s from 0, the variance will:\n","Answer: (iii) Steadily increase.\n","Explanation:\n","Variance measures how sensitive the model is to changes in the training data. As\n","𝑠\n","s increases, the model becomes more complex and flexible, causing predictions to vary significantly with small changes in the training data. Hence, variance increases steadily."],"metadata":{"id":"JHYXm6HlxQlg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(d) As we increase\n","𝑠\n","s from 0, the (squared) bias will:\n","Answer: (iv) Steadily decrease.\n","Explanation:\n","Squared bias measures systematic error due to model simplicity. A simple model (low\n","𝑠\n","s) cannot fully capture the true patterns in the data, leading to high bias. As\n","𝑠\n","s increases, the model becomes more capable of fitting the data and reduces bias steadily."],"metadata":{"id":"NwT9p2NuxTyc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(e) As we increase\n","𝑠\n","s from 0, the irreducible error will:\n","Answer: (v) Remain constant.\n","Explanation:\n","The irreducible error is due to noise and variability inherent in the data, not the model.
