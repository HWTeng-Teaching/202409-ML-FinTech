As\n","𝜆\n","λ increases, the penalty term (in methods like Ridge or Lasso regression) grows, shrinking the regression coefficients toward zero. This reduces the model's ability to fit the training data, leading to an increase in training RSS."],"metadata":{"id":"s-mtVsPfyFpz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(b) As we increase\n","𝜆\n","λ from 0, the test RSS will:\n","Answer: (ii) Decrease initially, and then eventually start increasing in a U shape.\n","Explanation:\n","Initially, a small\n","𝜆\n","λ helps prevent overfitting, improving generalization and decreasing test RSS. However, as\n","𝜆\n","λ becomes too large, the model underfits the data, leading to an increase in test RSS. This behavior results in a U-shaped curve."],"metadata":{"id":"NlyL_oBJyOgi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(c) As we increase\n","𝜆\n","λ from 0, the variance will:\n","Answer: (iv) Steadily decrease.\n","Explanation:\n","Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to changes in the training data.

As\n","𝜆\n","λ increases, the model becomes overly constrained and less capable of capturing the true patterns in the data, causing the squared bias to steadily increase."],"metadata":{"id":"kZGOtI9VyY_T"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(e) As we increase\n","𝜆\n","λ from 0, the irreducible error will:\n","Answer: (v) Remain constant.\n","Explanation:\n","The irreducible error is a property of the data itself and depends on inherent noise.
