### Abstract
The prediction of credit defaults is a significant challenge in the financial sector, where accurate forecasting can reduce risks for lenders. This study investigates the performance of several machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost—on the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, a large-scale dataset containing 300,000+ loan records and 121 features. The study also explores the effects of dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), on model performance. The evaluation focuses on classification accuracy, precision, recall, and the ability to identify defaulted loans, with the aim of determining the best model and assessing the impact of feature selection and reduction on model outcomes.
