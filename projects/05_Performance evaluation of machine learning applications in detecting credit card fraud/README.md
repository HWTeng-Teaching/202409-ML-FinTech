# Performance evaluation of machine learning applications in detecting credit card fraud
## By Kun ta Pao, Yi ling Kuo
Credit card fraud detection has become increasingly important as online transactions grow, leading to a rise in fraudulent activities. This study applies machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, RandomForest, and XGBoost, to accurately identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing transaction patterns and detecting anomalies. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score. The results indicate that each model has its strengths, with XGBoost showing particularly strong performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. These findings offer insights into selecting the most effective algorithm for real-world fraud detection applications.
