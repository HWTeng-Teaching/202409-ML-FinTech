# Data-Driven Workflow for Predicting Stock Trends in Dating App Companies

By Hsuan-Ting Ho

In this study, we present a data-driven workflow for predicting stock trends of online dating companies. By leveraging historical stock price data and incorporating key technical indicators such as Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and MACD, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by clustering and classification models to identify stock trend patterns. The study evaluates various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict short-term stock trends categorized as upward, downward, or neutral. Backtesting results highlight the challenges of forecasting volatile market behaviors, with the highest model accuracy reaching approximately 56\%. This approach underscores the importance of refining feature engineering and integrating external macroeconomic factors for improved predictive performance. Our findings provide insights into the dynamic market dynamics of the online dating industry and demonstrate the potential of machine learning in developing robust trading strategies.
