This project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying credit card applicants as ’good’ or ’bad’ clients based on historical data. Utilizing two key datasets, we analyze applicants’ demographic and financial attributes alongside their monthly credit behavior. The project tackles two primary challenges: constructing a reliable ’good’ or ’bad’ label through vintage analysis, and addressing class imbalance—a common issue in credit scoring tasks. We evaluate traditional logistic regression models against advanced machine learning algorithms, including Boosting and Random Forest, to determine the model that best predicts client creditworthiness. By integrating demographic and credit behavior data, this project seeks to enhance predictive accuracy in credit scoring.
