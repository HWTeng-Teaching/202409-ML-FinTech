# Winner Trades All - NVIDIA Stock Prediction

By Hsu-Chen Hsiao, Ka-Ho Soo, Tzu-Ping Wang

Stock price prediction has always been a popular topic for machine-learning and deep-learning. With the price of NVIDIA stocks soaring to unprecedented heights in recent years, we became interested in using the NVIDIA data to explore how well one can predict the rising and falling of stock prices with different ML/DL techniques, and how
the current methods may be improved upon. The research uses historical NVIDIA stock data between 2010 to 2024. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to identify data integrity as well as potentially useful features. We will evaluate several machine learning methods as our baseline, then implement different techniques and
compare the predictive power of our model against the baseline. The research aims to identity potential methods or factors that may improve the accuracy of stock price fluctuation predictions
