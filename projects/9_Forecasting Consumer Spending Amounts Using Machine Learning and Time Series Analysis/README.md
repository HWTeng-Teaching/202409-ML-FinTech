## Abstract
In the modern digital economy, accurately predicting consumer spending has become a critical task for businesses and financial institutions to effectively manage risk, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance financial planning. This study develops a machine learning model combined with time series analysis to predict consumer spending amounts based on socioeconomic and transactional data. Key features include income, age group, education level, industry category, and transaction date components, which provide seasonal and cyclical insights into consumer behavior. By leveraging advanced regression techniques, including Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, we achieve robust predictions of spending amounts over time. Our findings align with prior research, suggesting that incorporating time-related variables significantly improves prediction accuracy, offering actionable insights into seasonal consumer behavior patterns. This research contributes to the growing literature on data-driven decision-making frameworks for financial and marketing applications.
