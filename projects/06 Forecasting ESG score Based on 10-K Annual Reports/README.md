# Forecasting ESG score Based on 10-K Annual Reports

By Yu-Chi Liao 

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) awareness has gained increasing prominence among corporations, investors, and stakeholders due to its critical role in sustainable business practices and long-term value creation. ESG scores have emerged as essential metrics for evaluating corporate sustainability and have become significant references in stock price prediction models. This study investigates the relationship between a company's 10-K annual reports and its ESG score performance, leveraging textual data from these reports to forecast the latest ESG scores. Using the past decade of 10-K filings, we develop a machine learning framework that extracts relevant features and predicts future ESG scores. By correlating these scores with stock price trends, this research aims to establish ESG scores as a critical input for more comprehensive stock price forecasting models. The findings highlight the relevance of 10-K disclosures in capturing ESG-related performance, providing a novel approach to integrate financial and non-financial data into predictive analytics for informed decision-making in investment strategies.
