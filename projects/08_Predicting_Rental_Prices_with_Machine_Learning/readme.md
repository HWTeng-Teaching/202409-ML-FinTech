# Predicting Rental Prices with Machine Learning: Insights and Applications

By Hung-Cheng Chang

The rapid advancement of machine learning has revolutionized the way we analyze and predict real-world phenomena, including rental pricing in the housing market. This study explores the application of four machine learning methods—linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost—to accurately predict rental prices. By leveraging diverse datasets encompassing property attributes, geographic information, and market trends, we evaluate these models using key performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R2. The results reveal that random forest achieves the best performance in minimizing MAE, while XGBoost excels in terms of MSE and R2.
